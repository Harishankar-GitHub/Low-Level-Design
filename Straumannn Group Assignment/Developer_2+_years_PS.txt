Problem statement:

As a Software Engineer you are provided a requirement to develop a library which would be used in our world class  CAD/CAM devices. The requirements are as follows:
	1. The library is capable of providing a list of free ports present in a device
	2. The library (with abstraction) accepts the number of free ports (numOfFreePorts) to be returned 
	3. The library checks from a range (rangeOfPorts) of ports and finds out the free ports which is in-between/also part of the range
	4. This library would be used in a multi-threaded environment.

Constraints:
	1. rangeOfPorts: (10000 <= n)
	2. 0 < numOfFreePorts <=  55535
	
Note: Implementation should cover all cases
